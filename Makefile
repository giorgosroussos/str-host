# STR Host root command contract (AGENTS.md "Commands").
#
# `check-docs`, `check-locks`, `verify-chain`, the two `rebuild-*` targets,
# `install-hooks` and `unlock` are real from the first commit. Every other target is delivered by
# the work package named in its recipe and, until then, fails with that message
# instead of passing: a missing gate and a passing gate must never look alike.
# FND-01 replaces the placeholder bodies with the real commands; the target list
# itself is the contract and does not change without a DECISIONS.md entry.
